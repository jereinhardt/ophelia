This is my first project.  I hope it goes well, for in the coming years, there will be much more that needs to happen to make the people around other people ensure that there is nothing that will go wrong with anything at all so help me god.

Some of the things that were considered in this project were:

- what considerations need to go into it
- what the client wanted out of it
- what to competative market looked like
- what the client's strengths were in that competative market
- how to hightlight those strengths for market penetration

If I had to order my priorities on this assignment, it would be:

1. Get to know the client
2. Get to know the client's problems
3. Solve those problems
4. Profit (first the client, then me)

If you were to ask my client what they thought, they would have this to say:

> It was a great joy working with someone like this because we weren't sure what to expect going in.  We had some experience playing around with it ourselves, but we could never quite get our heads around it in the first place.  Luckily, Ophelia made it easy for us to understand and was able to work with or level of experience in understanding to create the best possible product.
